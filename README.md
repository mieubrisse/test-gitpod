Welcome to the Kurtosis Playground!
===================================

Here you have:

- The `kurtosis` CLI installed, with tab completion enabled
- The Kurtosis VSCode plugin installed

Play around to your heart's content!

Some ideas:

- Play around with adding [Starlark instructions](https://docs.kurtosis.com/starlark-reference) to the `main.star` file in the `fresh-package` directory, running it with `kurtosis run main.star`
- Try following [the quickstart](https://docs.kurtosis.com/quickstart) inside the `quickstart` directory
- Clone the [Awesome Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/awesome-kurtosis) repo and try running some of those
- Running `kurtosis enclave dump` on an enclave and sending the enclave to a friend
